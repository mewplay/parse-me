# Parse me

The aim of the *parse me* repository is to provide a set of parsing challenges for the LLVM IR library to solve. Inspiration is taken from *crack me* challenges which encourage learning of reverse engineering through sets of incrementally more difficult challenges.

* [ ] [hello](hello/): *"Hello world"* example.
* [ ] [rand](rand/): Borland C/C++ pseudo-random number generator.
